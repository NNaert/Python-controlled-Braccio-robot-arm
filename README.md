# Python-controlled-Braccio-robot-arm

1. Upload the arduino code on the arduino board.
2. Unplug the Arduino board and close the arduino IDE.
3. Place both Python files in the same folder.
4. Adapt the COM port in the 'braccio_control_python.py' file to match the COM port of your arduino.
5. Install the required packages.
6. Run 'braccio_control_python.py'.
7. Use the different definitions to control the arm.

Note that the code could not work on your arm due to the different ways to assemble the arm! The code is written for the arm I use.
